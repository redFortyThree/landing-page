# landing-page
ok so i want to do a fathers day page. today is wednesday 6/11/25 and fathers day is sunday 6/15/25. Thats nice because it provides for me a hard (meaning firm) but extremely doable deadline.

Its a basic website design using html and css skills I've learned working through the Odin project so far.
